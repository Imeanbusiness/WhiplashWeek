        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhiplash week is a week we take to appreciate the greatness of the Whiplash movie. This week is primarily for jazz drummers who also love the movie Whiplash! Common practices include worshipping miles teller and J.K Simmons, over playing Caravan, and sleeping to Overture! And also, it is common to watch Whiplash every single day of Whiplash Week and become obsessed with it! Make sure that you have a special Whiplash Activity to do every day.
